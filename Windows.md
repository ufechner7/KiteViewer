# Windows

If you want to use Kiteviewer on Windows, I suggest to install

1. a decent editor, for example VSCodium

2. Git for Windows. During installation, selec VSCodium as editor.

3. Julia. During installation select "Add Julia to the path." 

Git for Windows will not only provide the git version control system, but also a bash shall. When using the bash shall you can use the same commands that I am suggesting in [README.md](./README.md)  for Linux.
